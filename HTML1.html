3. What is GET and POST in forms, and how are they used?
GET and POST are two methods used to send data from a form to a server.

GET: Sends form data appended to the URL as query parameters. It’s suitable for non-sensitive data and when you want the data to be bookmarkable.
Example: form action="submit_form.php" method="get"
POST: Sends form data in the body of the HTTP request, not in the URL. It’s used for submitting sensitive data and larger amounts of data.
