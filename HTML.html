1. What are inline and block elements in HTML, and what is the difference between them? Can you name a few inline and block elements?
Inline elements in HTML are those that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Block elements, on the other hand, always start on a new line and take up the full width available.

Inline Elements: <span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>.
Block Elements: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <ul>.
The main difference is that block elements create larger structures in the layout, while inline elements are typically used within block elements to style specific parts of the content.


2. How do you work with images in HTML, and can you explain in detail the <img> tag and its important attributes?
To work with images in HTML, you use the <img> tag, which is an inline element. The <img> tag is used to embed images into your web page.

Important Attributes:
src: Specifies the path to the image file.
alt: Provides alternative text for the image, which is important for accessibility and SEO.
width and height: Control the display size of the image.
title: Provides additional information when the user hovers over the image.
Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image" width="500" height="300">.
 

3.How do you create lists in HTML?
Lists in HTML can be created using different types of list tags:

Ordered List (<ol>): Creates a numbered list.
Unordered List (<ul>): Creates a bulleted list.
List Items (<li>): Represents an individual item within a list.
Example:
html
Copy code
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>


4. How do you create links between web pages and navigate people to other websites?
You create links between web pages using the <a> (anchor) tag in HTML. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page you want to link to.

To link to another webpage on your site: <a href="about.html">About Us</a>.
To link to an external website: <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>.
The target="_blank" attribute opens the link in a new tab, which is useful when navigating to external sites.
