1. What are the new things introduced in HTML5?
HTML5 introduced several new features and improvements over previous versions:

New Semantic Elements: Tags like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section> define the structure of a document.
Multimedia Support: Native support for audio and video through <audio> and <video> tags, eliminating the need for third-party plugins.
Graphics and Effects: The <canvas> element allows for drawing graphics directly in the browser, and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is natively supported.
New Input Types: Form elements like <input type="email">, <input type="date">, and <input type="range"> improve user input handling.
APIs and Scripting: New APIs like Geolocation, Web Storage, Web Workers, and WebSocket enhance the capabilities of web applications.
Improved Accessibility: Enhanced support for ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles to improve accessibility.
Offline Support: The ApplicationCache and later Service Workers enable offline capabilities and faster load times for web applications.


2.What are semantic tags, and can you give a couple of examples?
Semantic tags are HTML elements that convey meaning about the content they enclose, helping both the browser and developers understand the structure and purpose of the content.

Examples:
<header>: Represents the header section of a document or a section, typically containing introductory content or navigation links.
<article>: Defines an independent, self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.
What are some uses of semantic tags?
Semantic tags have several important uses:

Improved SEO: Search engines can better understand and rank web pages by analyzing the meaningful structure provided by semantic tags.
Enhanced Accessibility: Screen readers and other assistive technologies can navigate and interpret content more effectively when semantic tags are used, making websites more accessible to users with disabilities.
Better Code Readability: Semantic tags make the code easier to read and understand, improving collaboration among developers and making maintenance easier.
Consistent Structure: They provide a consistent structure for web content, which is beneficial for responsive design and cross-platform compatibility.
